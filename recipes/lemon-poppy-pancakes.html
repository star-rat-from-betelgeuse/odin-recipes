    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I love lemon poppy seed muffins and who doesn't love pancakes? So I 
        brought the flavors together in this fluffy pancake recipe one lazy 
        Sunday morning, and we loved them. It's quick to make and adds a little 
        something extra to our weekend breakfasts. I hope you enjoy them on YOUR 
        lazy Sunday morning.</p>
    
    <div class="ing-box"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <div class="ingredients"><ul>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon poppy seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
      </ul></div></div>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Stir the milk, vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl; let stand 
            10 minutes to curdle. Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla extract. </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking 
            soda, salt, poppy seeds, and lemon zest until well combined. Pour the 
            milk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk a few times until the batter 
            is mostly free of lumps.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 
            cup of batter per pancake into the skillet and cook until bubbles appear 
            on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes over with a spatula and 
            brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.</li>
      </ol>
