        <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 
            9-inch springform pan. </li>
        <li>To make the crust: Mix 1 1/2 cups chocolate wafer crumbs, melted 
            butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar together in a small bowl until well 
            combined; press onto the bottom and 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the 
            prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; allow to cool. 
            Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Heat 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup chocolate 
            chips in a small saucepan, stirring constantly, until chips are melted. 
            Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese and 1 cup of sugar with an electric mixer in a large 
            bowl until smooth. Add cocoa and beat well. Add eggs and beat on low 
            until just blended. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and melted chocolate-cream 
            mixture until blended; pour filling over crust. </li>
        <li>Bake cheesecake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface 
            of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will 
            jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 45 to 50 minutes. Run the tip 
            of a table knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a wire rack, 
            and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature.</li>
        <li>To make the chocolate topping: Place 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips in a medium 
            bowl. Heat 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a small saucepan, 
            stirring continuously, until just before boiling; pour hot cream over 
            chocolate chips and stir with a spoon until smooth. Spread over baked 
            cheesecake and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight.</li>
